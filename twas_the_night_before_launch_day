## Twas the Night Before Launchday

==

Twas the night before Launchday, so I created a branch
to explore a new feature, without taking a chance
The master was safely checked into Github
So I felt fairly confident I would do nothing too dumb

With fresh user stories, in a new Trello board
I set straight to hacking, upon my keyboard
The migrations were easy, and I kept my code DRY
When I found myself stymied I just opened pry

It was like this for hours, oh how the time flew
I was nearing completion before I even knew
So I ran the full test suite and prepared to submit
My newly born feature, pushed the branch up to git

The code was perfection, all the tests glowing green
And according to rubocop, the formatting pristine
And the feature was working, time to submit a request
To pull this code into master, at a reviewers behest

With my pull request posted, I waited anxiously
To see my code merged into the master tree
When suddenly on Slack there arose such a clatter
I read through the postings, to see what was the matter

The devs were all clacking, away at their keys
When a big network outage, brought the team to their knees
'Is the wireless down?' I heard someone query
'It could be a DOS attack!' someone raised the theory

Tried pinging Heroku, and AWS  
Even Google and Apple ignored the requests
