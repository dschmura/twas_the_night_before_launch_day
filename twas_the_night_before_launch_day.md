## Twas the Night Before Launchday

Twas the night before Launchday, so I created a branch<br>
to explore a new feature, without taking a chance<br>
The master was safely checked into [Github](http://github.com/ "Github") <br>
So I felt fairly confident I would do nothing too dumb<br>

With fresh user stories, in a new [Trello](http://trello.com/ "Trello") board<br>
I set straight to hacking, upon my keyboard<br>
The migrations were easy, and I kept my code DRY<br>
When I found myself stymied I just opened [Pry](http://pryrepl.org "Pry")<br>

It was like this for hours, oh how the time flew<br>
I was nearing completion before I even knew<br>
So I ran the full test suite and prepared to submit<br>
My newly born feature, pushed the branch up to [Git](https://git-scm.com "Git")<br>

The code was perfection, all the tests glowing green<br>
And according to [Rubocop](http://batsov.com/rubocop/ "Rubocop") , the formatting pristine<br>
And the feature was working, time to submit a request<br>
To pull this code into master, at a reviewers behest<br>

With my pull request posted, I waited anxiously<br>
To see my code merged into the master tree<br>
When suddenly on [Slack](http://slack.com "Slack") there arose such a clatter<br>
I read through the postings, to see what was the matter<br>

The devs were all clacking, away at their keys<br>
When a big network outage, brought the team to their knees<br>
'Is the wireless down?' I heard someone query<br>
'It could be a DOS attack!' someone raised the theory<br>

Tried pinging [Heroku](http://heroku.com "Heroku"), and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com "AWS")<br>
Even [Google](http://google.com "Google") and [Apple](http://apple.com "Apple") ignored the requests<br>
